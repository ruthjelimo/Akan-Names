        <p>
            Akan names come from a traditional naming system for people from Ghana<br>
            A childâ€™s name is determined by factors surrounding his or her birth.<br>
            For example, the day of their birth or the manner in which they were born<br>
            may determine which name they get irrespective of their gender. <br>
            These Akan names signify the day one is born. According to Akan tradition, <br>
            each child is born with a name associated to their soul.
